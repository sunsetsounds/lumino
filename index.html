						<div class="content">
							<h3>Design Philosophy and Overview</h3>
							<p><strong>Lumino+ and Lumino</strong> are portable HiFi speakers that place a strong emphasis on sound quality and attention to detail.
								Before Lumino, high fidelity audio systems were confined to static home setups to provide outstanding listening experience.
								Portable speakers sacrifice sound quality and attention to detail for the sake of convenience and high unit production in a fast market.
								Now, Sunset Sounds has developed and engineered Lumino, an audio solution
							 which brings out the best in HiFi and portable speakers by putting superior sound reproduction in a portable form factor. Lumino is
							 also 3D printed to allow for a unique design and handcrafted for the best product finish and care. For the first time, you can bring
							 HiFi quality audio wherever you go!

						<div class="content">
							<h3 class="icon solid fa-volume-up"> Drivers Built for HiFi</h3>
							<p>Our pride in Lumino lies in its amazing audio reproduction with a 2-way system. A high excursion <strong>4-inch woofer</strong> driving two 4-inch passive radiators
							delivers <b>deep, dreamy bass</b> never thought possible in a small speaker. Aluminum cones and neodymium magnets ensure excellent linearity and low distortion through
						the midrange. Finally, a <b>1-1/8 inch soft dome neodymium tweeter</b> brings <b>detail and clarity</b> unlike any other portable system, complementing the woofer magnificently.
						This all means that Lumino brings the whole soundstage to you, with big sound (103dB) in a portable package.

						<hr>

						<h3 class="icon solid fa-wave-square"> Pure and Precise Output</h3>
						<p>A <b>class-D 2x50W amplifier</b> provides clean, high quality audio to Lumino's drivers. The TPA3116 chip operates at 88% efficiency for better battery life
							while still having high output levels. Total harmonic distortion and noise (THD+N) is kept in check at 1% with full output, but is optimized for listening around
							97db, where <b>THD+N is at a mere 0.06%</b> for the best clarity and detail.

						</div>
						<hr>
							<h3 class="icon solid fa-microchip"> Intelligent Bass Control</h3>
							<p>
								An ADAU1701 Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip is built on-board to allow
								Lumino to tune the audio system with advanced crossover networks and dynamic bass boost. Lumino <strong>intelligently
								adjusts the bass output</strong> based on current listening levels to compensate for psychoacoustic inaccuracies in human hearing.

						<p> <b>More than just wireless Bluetooth.</b> Lumino features special Bluetooth codecs that limit distortion and lower latency
							 in the audio supply chain, supporting <b>APTx, APTx LL, and AAC codecs</b>.
							 In addition, Lumino includes a standard 3.5mm jack so you can stream music from almost any device. As a bonus feature, this 3.5mm jack
							 serves as an output, <b>allowing Lumino to drive other speakers</b> and audio systems when you stream through Bluetooth. See our guide <a href="">here</a>

							 <h3 class="icon solid fa-battery-full"> Dependable Battery Performance</h3>
							 Lumino+ is powered by a 12V 5000mAh (2380mAh in Lumino) li-ion battery pack. This gives our speaker an effective playtime of <b>over 50 hours</b> (25 hours for Lumino). The included
							 AC adapter charges Lumino+ in about <b>1.5 hours</b>. This means that you can comfortably use Lumino anywhere to play music for hours on end without having to worry about
							 charging. And when Lumino does need a charge, 30 minutes of charging time is enough for 8 hours of playback time!

										<h2><b>Handcrafted and 3D Printed</b></h2>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
										<p>It might be hard to believe at this price point, but our speakers are handcrafted and assembled with care in San Francisco by our small team.
										In addition, the chassis is 3D printed in a process that takes well over 72 hours to achieve a design nearly impossible to replicate with other methods.
										For Lumino+, top half is <b>3D printed Wood PLA</b> and the
									bottom half is printed with PETG. As for the standard Lumino, both halves are 3D printed PETG. Although this version isn't as
									special without 3D printed wood, Lumino still receives the same incredible attention to detail and finishing the plus version does.
									 Even the flexible handle is 3D printed with a special elastic filament TPU. Our <strong>10+ stage processing and finishing
									method</strong> is highlighted in detail <a href="">here</a> to show how much attention and care our speakers receive.

										<h3 class="icon solid fa-chart-area"> Why 3D Print? - Methodology</h3>
										<p>
											You are probably aware that most speakers are not 3D printed. Most are mass produced by machines in China and injection molded or made from
											wood fiber boards.
											Sunset Sounds chooses to 3D print its speakers because in addition to being <b>extremely unique</b>,
											it is the most <b>economical and sustainable</b> method. Injection molding has a high up front cost and also its mass production can cause
											an excess in product, leading to waste. By utilizing 3D printing, we can produce according to demand and <b>reduce excess waste</b> (pull production). It also enables us to put a
											<b>high amount of attention</b> to creating the final product. 3D printing also allows us to create a more unique and intricate design when compared
											to using standard wood boards.

											Our choice in 3D printing materials is important to the sustainable process. The three materials we use on Lumino are
											<b>PLA/Wood PLA</b> (Polyactic Acid), <b>PETG</b> (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol), and <b>TPU</b>(Thermoplastic Polyurethane).

											<div id="woodpla" class="collapse" style="height: 0; opacity: 0;">
												<hr>
											<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
											Wood PLA,
											which is used on Lumino+, is a special filament made with 20% recycled wood fibers and 80% PLA. PLA is a plant-based
											and is an <b>entirely renewable resouce</b> and is <b>biodegradable</b>. This makes Wood PLA a very sustainable choice in material in addition
											to being <b>recyclable and industrially compostable</b>. PLA has very high strength, but it is not very ductle, leading to
											lower durability compared to PETG. <u>This does mean that Lumino, not using PLA in favor of PETG, is more durable and shock resistant
											than compared to Lumino+.</u>
											</p>

											</div>

											<div id="petg" class="collapse" style="height: 0; opacity: 0;">
												<hr>
												<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
											PETG, used on the bottom half of Lumino+ and the entirety of Lumino's enclosure, is a strong and flexible material,
											making it more effective at protection when compared to PLA. Much like PLA, PETG is <b>recyclable</b> but is not biodegradable
											because it is <b>oil based</b>. Still being recyclable, PETG is still a sustainable choice of materials when treated properly
											and we are currently working on implementing a biodegradable PETG solution!
										</p>
										</div>


										<div id="tpu" class="collapse" style="height: 0; opacity: 0;">
											<hr>
											<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
											TPU is an extremely flexible filament that is used for Lumino's handle. This material with its high elasticity, shear strength, and flexural strength
											give the handle a high quality and robust feel. TPU is sustainable choice because of its decent biodegradability. This material is <b>recyclable</b>, but Sunset
											Sounds is working on a plant-based TPU alternative to allow for industrial compostability!
